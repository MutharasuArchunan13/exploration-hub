# Study Tips
1. Code every day, even if just for 30 minutes
2. Implement data structures from scratch to understand their internals
3. Use visualization tools to understand algorithm flow
4. Start with simpler problems and gradually increase difficulty
5. Review and refactor your solutions after completing them

# Resources for Practice
- LeetCode: Focus on Easy and Medium problems initially
- Visualgo.net: For visualizing data structures and algorithms
- GitHub: Store your implementations and projects
- GeeksforGeeks: For detailed explanations and variations
